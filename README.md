## Hi! Welcome to my personal graphic design portfolio

I built this project from scratch over the period of a few months, simultaneously creating my brand identity, and building out case studies. 
It's made up of mostly HTML/CSS, with a tiny bit of javascript that I challenged myself to touch with a 10 foot poll.
Have a look around! Any and all feedback is much appreciated.
Oh, and don't look too hard at my CSS comments, those are between me and god.
